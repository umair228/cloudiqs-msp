# CloudiQS MSP - Temporary Elevated Access Management for AWS IAM Identity Center
This repository contains the source code for deploying TEAM application with **MSP Multi-Customer enhancements**.

## 🆕 MSP Multi-Customer Features

This fork extends the AWS TEAM solution with **Managed Service Provider (MSP)** capabilities:

- **Multi-Customer Management**: Organize AWS accounts by customer organization
- **Customer-Specific Access Control**: Assign approvers and eligibility policies per customer
- **Customer Context Tracking**: Every access request and session is tagged with customer information
- **Customer-Scoped Auditing**: Filter and export audit logs by customer organization
- **Backwards Compatible**: Works seamlessly with existing TEAM deployments

## 🚀 Deployment & Sync Workflows

### Quick Deployment

**TL;DR**: To deploy latest changes, run: `git push codecommit main`

### Documentation Guides

- **[GitHub ↔ CodeCommit Sync Guide](GITHUB_CODECOMMIT_SYNC.md)** - Understand the dual-repo workflow and sync methods
- **[GitHub Actions Setup](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)** - Automatic sync from GitHub to CodeCommit
- **[Quick Deploy Guide](QUICK_DEPLOY.md)** - Fast reference for pushing updates to AWS
- **[Redeployment Guide](REDEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive deployment procedures
- **[AWS CodeCommit Authentication](AWS_CODECOMMIT_AUTH.md)** - Fix 403 errors and credential issues

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Set up GitHub Actions to automatically sync GitHub → CodeCommit → Amplify:

1. **Configure AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets** (one-time setup)
2. **Push to GitHub main branch** - that's it!
3. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Pushes to CodeCommit
   - Triggers Amplify build
   - Deploys your application

See [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Push to GitHub (version control)
git push origin main

# Push to CodeCommit (triggers Amplify deployment)
git push codecommit main
```

**Getting 403 errors?** See [AWS_CODECOMMIT_AUTH.md](AWS_CODECOMMIT_AUTH.md) for authentication setup.

**Confused about the workflow?** See [GITHUB_CODECOMMIT_SYNC.md](GITHUB_CODECOMMIT_SYNC.md) for detailed explanation.

## About TEAM

TEAM is an open source solution that integrates with AWS IAM Identity Center and allows you to manage and monitor time-bound elevated access to your multi-account AWS environment at scale.

The solution is a custom application that allows users to **request access to an AWS account** only when it is needed and only **for a specific period of time**. Once the time period has elapsed, elevated access is automatically removed.

Refer to the [blog post on the AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/temporary-elevated-access-management-with-iam-identity-center/) for a background and an overview of the TEAM solution.
